# Task: Python Pattern Drawing
#
# Create six different patterns using Python's printing capabilities.
# Pattern 1: Right-angled Triangle
#
# Develop a Python script that generates a right-angled triangle pattern. The script should prompt the user to specify the number of rows. Here's a sample output for a user input of 5:
#
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****
#
# Pattern 2: Square with Hollow Center
#
# Craft a Python program that produces a square pattern with a hollow center. The program should take the size of the square as input from the user. Here's an example output for a user input of 5:
#
# *****
# *   *
# *   *
# *   *
# *****
#
# Pattern 3: Diamond
#
# Write a Python script that displays a diamond pattern based on the number of rows (height) specified by the user. For instance, if the user enters 5, the output should resemble the following:
#
#   *
#  ***
# *****
#  ***
#   *
#
# Pattern 4: Left-angled Triangle
#
# Design a Python code snippet to print a left-angled triangle pattern. The user should provide the number of rows. For instance, if the user inputs 4, the output should be:
#
# ****
# ***
# **
# *
#
# Pattern 5: Hollow Square
#
# Implement a Python program that prints a square pattern with a hollow center, where the user specifies the size of the square. For example, if the user inputs 6, the output should be:
#
# ******
# *    *
# *    *
# *    *
# *    *
# ******
#
# Pattern 6: Pyramid
#
# Create a Python script that prints a pyramid pattern based on the user-input number of rows. For example, if the user inputs 4, the output should be:
#
#    *
#   ***
#  *****
# *******
#
# âž¡ Instructions:
#
#     Utilize nested loops to control the row and column structure of each pattern.
#     Use the print function to output patterns. For spacing, consider using either the space character (" ") or tabs ("\t").
#     Prompt the user to enter the necessary parameters for each pattern.
